Theme Name: Pinnacle 
Theme URI: https://kadencewp.com/product/pinnacle-free-theme/
Description: Pinnacle is a "Classic" theme built before the WordPress Block editor was created. While it supports the block editor, it wasn't built to be optimized for the block editor (because the block editor wasn't created). For modern development, we suggest using the Kadence Theme. Pinnacle is a bold theme with a versatile theme options panel for multiple styles. Its fully responsive layout makes for easy navigation on mobile/tablet displays. Pinnacle is fully compatible with woocommerce and gives you a unique layout for an e-commerce site.
